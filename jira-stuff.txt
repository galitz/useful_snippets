# normally the jira GUI limits you to 1000 issues max, the API appears to be unlimited

# Simple JQL statement to look for stuff (can be used in conflunce, too)

labels = "SOME_label" and status changed during (-120d, now())  and status = "closed"

## some random examples:
project = security AND status in ("In Progress‚Äù) AND resolution = Unresolved AND created <= -30d ORDER BY created DESC, priority DESC, updated DESC


project = "Security Vulnerability Management" AND status in (Closed) and labels = Cleartext_Passwords
