# useful_snippets

This is a collection of snippets that I found I had to 
spend a little time to figure out and not kill days and 
days trying to reproduce again.  Probably the best way
to use this is clone the repo and then grep through it 
for things.  e.g. "git grep -i insightvm" if you admin 
InsightVM/Nexpose.
